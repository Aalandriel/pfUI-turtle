# pfUI-Turtle

An extensions for [pfUI](https://github.com/shagu/pfUI) which adds a few skins for the [Turtle WoW server](https://turtle-wow.org/#/home) custom UI elements and implements custom behaviour for a few classes' skills. If any skill is missing, please open an [issue](https://github.com/doorknob6/pfUI-turtle/issues/new/choose) to alert me to it. The latest version of pfUI is required.

## Features

Turtle WoW adds a couple of UI elements to the base game. This addon aims to make sure these new elements' design is in line with the rest of the UI.

These UI elements are currently included in this addon:

- Character frame title selection dropdown
- Inspect talents frame tab
- The Looking for Turtles dungeon finder tool

These custom class skills are included in this addon:

- Paladin [Holy Strike](https://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=679) refreshes seals on the target
